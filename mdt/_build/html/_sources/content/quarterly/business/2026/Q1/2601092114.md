# 非对称收益与抽佣模式

## 堕落主义

什么是堕落主义（Degeneracy）？

首先设想一个家庭情境：

- 幸福美满的家庭中有一对夫妇和他们的一双儿女。
- 丈夫已经在公司兢兢业业地工作了 20 余年，现在即将迎来升职与加薪。
- 作为家庭主妇的妻子非常开心，在自家的别墅中制作了一大桌丰盛的晚宴，然后安排妥当了家庭周末旅行。
- 大儿子马上大学毕业，已经通过在大型公司的实习即将转为正式职工。
- 还在上高中的小女儿有些烦闷，因为和她暧昧的男同学换了一个漂亮的女同桌。
- 夫妻二人的父母都还健在且有充足的退休金和医疗保障，他们退休后喜欢旅游、养宠物和打理园艺。

上面这个情境自从 1946 二战结束以来，不同时代的人看过后会有不同的看法：

- Baby Boomers(1946-1964) 会认为这是个人生活的写照。
- Gen X(1965-1980) 会认为这是努力就可以达到的目标。
- Gen Y(1981-1996) 会认为这个人生目标非常艰苦，有点像童话故事。
- Gen Z(1997-2012) 会对此嗤之以鼻，认为这只是老家伙们囚禁他们追求自由人生的牢笼。

为什么会有如此大的世代差距？显然是因为两次世界大战后，全球资源重新分配，Baby Boomers 一代人享受到了十足的全球经济发展的红利，社会文化和人际关系都有极高的容忍度，大家都愿意接受中规中矩的生活，稳定地学习、工作、成家、生子、退休，这在 Gen Z 看来是遥不可及的荒诞美梦。虽然全球不同经济体的发展有先后差别，但是不同经济体都存在这样的世代关系与差距，只是表现形式有所不同。

那么为什么这样的系统不能持续运转，难道 Baby Boomers 成为了上述情境中的祖辈后，Gen Z 不能成为上述情境中的孙辈吗？

在全球所有法定货币脱离实物锚定后，信用成为了唯一的约束。但是信用的稀释空间极大，且由此衍生出的货币更容易推高资产（黄金、权益、地产等）而非提高收入，原因就是掌握暴力和控制法律的群体正是稀释信用和拥有资产的群体。<mark>信用的稀释反映在债务总量和生产价值的比值越来越大，每代人向后代借债享受生活，却不承担还债的责任。由于一代又一代人的还债压力逐渐增大到不可承受，生育率迅速下滑导致即将面临没有后代承接还债责任的时代，因此这个看似可循环的系统就会崩溃。</mark>

Gen Y 后半群体、Gen Z 群体、Gen Alpha 以及更晚的世代从个人生活的经历会得出与 Baby Boomers 和 Gen X 完全不同的人生哲学，稳定地学习、工作、成家、生子、退休对他们来说不是追逐的梦想，而是拼命却依然遥不可及还耗尽一生的噩梦。<mark>他们戴着为前几个世代还债、反抗却被法律制裁和暴力镇压的枷锁负重前行。</mark>

<mark>传统的社会信用契约已经崩塌，与其刻苦工作和情感忠贞，不如赌博下注和攀附权贵，这就是堕落主义。</mark>

这些世代和此后的世代（下文称作“堕落世代”）都会拼命抓取任何能让他们获得“泼天富贵”机会的东西，寻求非对称收益。而卖给他们这些希望的就是带有高利抽佣模式的群体。

## 非对称收益

非对称收益最经典的实例就是彩票，一张价值不到百元的小奖券就有可能产生上万倍的回报，这种非对称收益就是堕落时代的救命稻草。但是只要还记得学习过的数学分支概率论中关于数学希望和大数定律的内容，就会意识到，如果没有内幕消息，仅凭借公平概率获得的回报还不足以支付购买彩票的成本，这是一种假性非对称收益。

<mark>真正的非对称收益都携带极大的信息不对称性。此外依靠大数定律是否能做到收敛，即大量低成本支出可以被少量高回报覆盖还有额外收益？这需要非常强大的信息搜集能力和扎实的数学原理基础。堕落世代中依靠非对称收益脱颖而出的人，就是踩在埋葬于假性非对称收益的群体尸首上。</mark>

## 抽佣模式

有没有依靠非对称收益但边界限制较低的方法呢？想一想“澳门赌王”何鸿燊的实例——赌王不赌只靠抽佣。

<mark>金融证券交易所、老鸨、毒贩...只抽佣而不参与的群体，不需要知道输赢好坏，只需要确保会有源源不断的参与者加入这个系统即可。</mark>

堕落世代参与的非对称收益系统与传统模式不同：

- 从彩票站贩卖的彩票，到 Polymarket 等平台将一切事件信息化的概率下注。
- 从现实互动色情，到 OnlyFans 等平台的虚拟互动色情。
- 从励志书籍影视，到社交媒体平台 KOL 贩卖的课程。
- 从收集古董潮玩，到收集 meme coin。

因此，Polymarket、OnlyFans、KOL 平台、meme coin 交易所等才是那个高利抽佣不赌的“赌王”。

## 总结

<mark>堕落世代的绝大多数人都将献祭给堕落主义，被动逃避不如积极面对，早期的堕落世代尚且有机会成为新型高利抽佣模式的 Baby Boomers，晚期的堕落世代只能沦为这些人的 Gen Z。</mark>

最后，难道真的没有让整个世代系统重新可循环的方法吗？不要忘记，Baby Boomers 能获得资源重分配红利的前提条件是两次世界大战摧毁了原有世代的资源，也许新一轮周期的 Baby Boomers 就是堕落世代的后代。

<summary>The Prison Of Financial Mediocrity｜一名量化交易者的愤世嫉俗：做多「堕落主义」</summary>

## Introduction

I am not a stock picker. I worship at the altar of a large breadth of low confidence (<= 53% win-rate) bets, but I am absolutely betting the house that long degeneracy is the prevalent socioeconomic theme of the coming century.

It is why people above the age of 40 will recommend you to get better at your job and increase your salary, whilst everyone else seem to be ignoring exactly THAT and desperately clawing at something, ANYTHING that can give them a shot of outrageous success.

The easiest thing to sell to a crowd like this is “hope”, and when you understand this, you will understand the rise of the casinos (in all forms, dexes, prediction markets, etc) and the rise of trading gurus, business gurus, courses, and of course... substacks.

## The Set-up

One doesn’t need to be locked up to be imprisoned. There is a generation walking around with invisible bars.

They know the life exists, the house, the stability, the reward for showing up and doing the right thing for thirty years. They know people have it. They just can’t imagine how to get there. Not “it’s hard”; they literally cannot construct a realistic path from where they are to where they’re supposed to end up.

The traditional path to wealth accumulation is closed. Not difficult. Closed. When boomers hold ~50% of national wealth while comprising 20% of the population, and millennials hold ~10% despite being the same share, the game reveals itself to be fundamentally broken.

The ladder got pulled up and it’s not like the boomers wanted to do this; asset price inflation just happened to benefit those who already owned assets. But the effect is the same.

## The Collapse of the Traditional Bargain

The implicit deal used to be simple: show up, work hard, stay loyal, and you’ll be rewarded. Companies offered pensions. Tenure meant something. Your house appreciated while you slept. The system worked if you trusted it.

**That deal is dead.**

Staying at one company for 20 years is now a career liability, not an asset. Wages grew 8% while housing costs doubled and debt payments for young people increased ~33%. The math doesn’t support patience anymore.

Looking at the bigger picture, I used to think it was bad, but with the advent of AI and the economic impact they are going to have (even with current technologies), **I think it is only going to get significantly worst.**

When the system stops rewarding patience, people stop being patient.

**Call it rational adaptation.**

## Push And Pull

Two forces are at work here.

### The Pull

Modern society has mostly solved the bottom tiers of Maslow’s hierarchy. Food is cheap. Basic shelter exists. Safety, healthcare, baseline employment, not guaranteed, but accessible enough that most young people aren’t fighting for survival.

Previous generations facing economic constraint had a different problem. When you’re worried about eating, you don’t have bandwidth for existential questions. The grind makes sense because the alternative is starvation. You take the stable job, you stay quiet, you don’t rock the boat - because the boat is keeping you alive.

**This generation doesn’t have that distraction.**

When survival is handled, humans reach for the next tier: belonging, esteem, self-actualization. They want experiences. They want meaning. They want to feel like their life is going somewhere, not just continuing. And the traditional paths to those higher needs, home ownership, career progression, financial security, are exactly what’s been blocked.

Collectively, we are apes that are reflexively scratching at the scab of our higher order needs of actualization, and the blood won’t stop flowing but we literally don’t know how to do better.

### The Push (and Why It’s Getting Worse)

AI is coming for white-collar jobs, and everyone knows it.

The anxiety isn’t hypothetical anymore. ChatGPT writes better copy than most junior marketers. Midjourney produces better visuals than entry-level designers. Cursor and Claude write code that passes review. This is now more or less universally accepted except by those with severe skill issues.

Every month brings new benchmarks showing AI matching or exceeding human performance on tasks that used to require expensive degrees and years of training.

White-collar workers, or otherwise **the financially aspirational**, are watching the timeline shrink. Three years ago, “AI will replace knowledge workers” was a thought experiment. Now it’s a planning assumption. **Everyone’s asking**_**when**_**, not**_**if**_**, and the estimates keep getting shorter.**

Then there’s social media, which ensures you’re never satisfied with where you are.

The algorithm is optimized to show you the next tranche of what could be. Always the vacation you haven’t taken. The apartment you can’t afford. The lifestyle one rung above yours. It doesn’t matter where you are on the ladder; there’s always someone above you, and the algorithm will find them.

Previous generations had limited visibility into how others lived. You compared yourself to your neighbors, your coworkers, maybe some celebrities in magazines. The reference class was narrow. Now the reference class is infinite. A 25-year-old making $70k is constantly fed content from people their age making $2mn, living in Bali, “working” four hours a day. The baseline for “enough” keeps moving.

You never catch up. No matter what you achieve, social media will show you what you’re missing. **The spread between your life and the life you “should” have is maintained algorithmically, forever uncollapsible.**

So you have AI shrinking your timeline AND social media ensuring you never feel like you’ve arrived. The pressure to escape, NOW, FAST, before it’s too late, compounds daily.

The anxiety is pervasive. Every white-collar worker has done the mental exercise: “Could AI do my job? When?” And most of them don’t love their answers. Even if they think they’re safe for now, “for now” keeps getting shorter.

So you have a generation that can’t afford the traditional milestones AND believes the traditional path might evaporate before they reach the destination anyway. Taking shots now, while the money and the opportunity still exist, is the rational response.

**Why grind for 20 years toward a promotion that might not exist in 10?**

## The Maslow Trap

When you can survive but can’t get anywhere, something breaks. You’re not desperate enough to accept any deal, but you’re blocked from the deals that actually matter. The cognitive bandwidth that would have gone to survival instead goes to... frustration. Searching. Looking for any path that might lead somewhere.

Career progression isn’t just income, it’s purpose, identity, the feeling that your work matters. Financial security isn’t just money, it’s the freedom to take risks, travel, build, create.

When these paths close AND the timeline to achieve them shrinks, the pressure has to go somewhere. **These prisoners need a way out, and BY GOD they need a way out NOW.**

## Agency In The Casino

I first saw it in the L1 Crypto; and dismissed it as a fad. Then I saw it again in NFTs, and then again and again in the entire shit show between NFTs and perp dexes and now, obviously, the “prediction markets supercycle”.

The same young people who can’t imagine grinding at one company will absolutely grind for months learning crypto trading. They will pour hours into understanding prediction markets to understand the very economy they believe wholeheartedly to be rigged. The same person who dismisses traditional investing as an “inside game” will bet their rent money on a memecoin.

Why?

**Because the casino is the only place they feel agency.** The only place where their decisions might actually unlock the next tier, on a timeline that matters.

Traditional career path? Your manager got promoted for being there first, not for being good, and your whole department might get automated anyway. Stock market? Sure, you can earn 10% annually and afford a house in 47 years, assuming your job still exists.

But crypto? Prediction markets? Sports betting? Your research actually matters here. Conviction pays. **Even an imagined edge feels like**_**yours**_**, not something you’re waiting for someone to grant you.** You’re placing bets where your judgment directly determines your results.

The house edge exists. Most people lose. I think MOST PEOPLE understand this. But they’re playing, not waiting for a future that might never arrive. The people preaching for these people to STOP GAMBLING have failed to understand the predicament of the prisoners, and always assume a kind of intellectual superiority that “you have negative edge”. **My position is that I think the gamblers absolutely understand that.**

The ones who say “gambling is bad, you should stop” are almost always the ones speaking from a privileged position of being in the financial upper class. They SEE a way out; they SEE a path. So they espouse the goodness and kindness of god on staying the path.

**For the many imprisoned, gambling is their salvation, and you are literally telling them to accept a life of eternal damnation.** That is why they rebel against you.That is why your well-intentioned advice falls on deaf ears.

## What Do The Numbers Look Like?

Prediction Markets: Polymarket and Kalshi did $10B+ in volume in November 2025 alone. Combined annual volume is approaching $40B. In 2020 this was essentially zero. The growth rate is vertical.

Sports Betting: Legal sports betting revenue went from $248M in 2017 to $13.7B in 2024. Gen Z and Millennials account for 76% of betting activity. Activity on online sportsbooks rose 7% year-over-year for both cohorts.

TransUnion’s report identified these gamblers as “speculators”: urban renters, heavy users of crypto apps, concentrated in mobile trading platforms. Young people locked out of traditional wealth-building, seeking asymmetric payoffs in the only markets that offer them.

## Economic Theory Supports This

When you’re trapped, your risk preferences change.

Economists call this “convex utility in losses”: when you’re already losing, you prefer a small chance of getting back to even over a certain moderate loss. It’s the same reason people double down at blackjack when they’re behind. It’s why lottery tickets sell better in poor neighborhoods.

My take is that **social media and our higher order needs have conditioned people that are positioned well below the financial upper class to feel like they are already at a loss.** The zeroth line has been repositioned. It is why you see unironic takes about the poverty line being at $150k. This generation isn’t gambling to survive, they’re gambling to actually have a life.

When your basic needs are met but your higher needs are blocked, money stops being about security and starts being about access. Access to experiences. Access to freedom. Access to the life you can see but can’t reach. A house isn’t just shelter; it’s the ability to have roots, build community, feel like an adult. Travel isn’t luxury; it’s the experience that makes life feel worth living.

For a generation that sees no realistic path to these things through conventional means, the expected value of a moonshot starts looking better than the expected value of grinding. If your baseline is “treading water forever,” then a PERCEIVED 5% chance of escaping is mathematically attractive against a 100% chance of staying stuck.

This isn’t financial illiteracy. It is **revealed preference under constraint.**

The memecoin degens, the sports bettors, the prediction market junkies, the trading guru subscriboors: they understand the odds are bad. They also understand their alternatives. When your options are “definitely stuck” or “probably stuck but with a small chance of being not,” the second option wins every time.

## Long Degeneracy

So: what do you buy?

If this diagnosis is right, that a generation of economically locked-out young people will continue seeking agency through high-variance financial products, then you want to be long anything that serves that demand.

The platforms win regardless of whether the users win. You are looking for platforms that doesn’t care if you win your bet or if your prediction is right. You are looking for businesses that extract fees from activity, and activity is growing.

Entrepreneurship: The ‘escape the 9-5’ industrial complex is enormous and growing. Course creators selling dropshipping tutorials. Coaches selling agency models. Gurus selling ‘how I made $100k/month’ playbooks. ‘**Start your own business’ is already the socially acceptable lottery ticket**; it feels productive, agentic, like you’re building something. **The fact that most entrepreneurs fail doesn’t dampen demand any more than bad odds dampen lottery sales.**

Prediction markets: Polymarket is raising at an $8-10B valuation. The combined TAM people cite is “the entire betting industry,” over a trillion dollars. Even if that’s optimistic by 90%, it’s a massive market.

Crypto infrastructure: Custody, trading, staking, lending. Every new wave of speculators needs on-ramps. Coinbase, Robinhood’s crypto arm, specialized exchanges; they all benefit from volume regardless of direction.

Sports betting operators: DraftKings, FanDuel, and their infrastructure providers. Legal sports betting is still rolling out state by state. The regulatory moat is real.

Social trading and community: Discord servers, X/Twitter accounts, Substack newsletters that cater to this audience. The attention is there. The willingness to pay for alpha is there.

The bet isn’t that any individual speculator wins. The bet is that the phenomenon persists. That the underlying economic conditions driving young people toward high-variance bets don’t change. That the platforms extracting fees from this activity continue to grow with the audience. That the financially imprisoned will parlay one bet to another, to another, to another, one must imagine Sispyhus filling out his 401st lottery ticket.

Given what we know about AI acceleration, housing costs, wealth distribution, and generational economics... does this seem like a temporary thing?

## The Moral Dimension

Look, this thesis is descriptive, not prescriptive.

Watching a generation seek financial salvation through lottery tickets, even sophisticated lottery tickets, isn’t something to celebrate. The fact that prediction markets and memecoins feel like the only path to agency is a symptom of something broken. The house wins. Most players lose.

But understanding what’s happening lets you position for it. Let’s you reflect on it.

The casinos of every era have profited from desperation. The desperation today is real, documented, and growing. The casinos are The Hope Sellers, Polymarket, Coinbase, DraftKings. They’re going to keep taking rake.

You can moralize about this or you can be long the platforms. It is unironically one of the ways you CAN get out.

## Conclusion

I leave you a story...

There’s a guy I know, smart, works in tech, makes good money by any historical standard. Last month he “invested” $100k farming perp dex points. Not because he thought it was a good investment.

Because, and I quote: “What else am I gonna do, save for 20 years and buy a condo when I’m 55?”

I just know he’s waiting for the next dex to come around so he’ll do it again.

How many of you are doing something like this?

How many of you know someone doing something like this?

**Long degeneracy.**

我并不是个选股高手。我崇尚的是在大量低胜率（%胜率）的押注中寻找广度，但我绝对在“梭哈”押注一个观点：**做多“堕落主义”（Degeneracy）将是未来一个世纪盛行的社会经济主题。**

为什么40岁以上的人会建议你精进业务、提高薪水，而其他所有人似乎都在无视这一点，转而拼命抓取任何能让他们获得“泼天富贵”机会的东西。

对于这样一群人，最容易卖出的东西就是“希望”。当你理解了这一点，你就会理解赌场（以各种形式存在：去中心化交易所、预测市场等）的兴起，以及交易大师、商业教父、付费课程，当然……还有各类Substack专栏的盛行。

## 设局 (The Set-up)

一个人不一定要被关起来才算身陷囹圄。有一代人正带着无形的枷锁行走。

他们知道那种生活是存在的：房子、稳定、三十年如一日打卡上班换来的回报。他们知道有人拥有这些，但他们完全无法想象自己如何到达那里。不是说“这很难”，而是他们**根本无法构建出一条现实的路径**，从现状通往他们本该到达的终点。

传统的财富积累之路已经关闭。不是变得困难，而是**关闭**了。当占人口20%的婴儿潮一代持有全国约50%的财富，而人数相当的千禧一代仅持有约 10% 时，这场游戏的本质已经崩坏。

梯子被抽走了。倒不是说婴儿潮一代故意为之，资产价格通胀只是恰好惠及了那些已经拥有资产的人。但结果是一样的。

## 传统契约的崩塌 (The Collapse of the Traditional Bargain)

过去，隐含的契约很简单：准时出勤、努力工作、保持忠诚，你就会得到回报。公司提供养老金，资历意味着地位，你的房子在你睡觉时增值。只要你信任这个系统，系统就有效。

**那个契约已经作废。**

在一家公司待上 20 年现在是职业负担，而非资产。工资增长了 8%，而住房成本翻了一番，年轻人的债务支出增加了约 33%。数学模型已经不再支持“耐心”。

从大局来看，我以前觉得情况很糟，但随着 AI 的出现及其将带来的经济冲击（即便仅凭现有技术），我认为情况只会显著恶化。

> 当系统不再奖励耐心时，人们就不再耐心。这叫作“理性适应”。

## 推力与拉力 (Push And Pull)

这里有两种力量在起作用。

### 拉力 (The Pull)

现代社会基本解决了马斯洛需求层次的底层。食物廉价，基础住所存在。安全、医疗、基层就业虽无保障，但对大多数年轻人来说并非遥不可及。

前几代面临经济拮据时，问题是不同的。当你担心吃饭时，你没有精力思考存在主义问题。这种“磨练”是有意义的，因为不磨练就会饿死。你接受稳定的工作，保持安静，不兴风作浪，因为这艘船正载着你活命。**这一代人没有这种干扰。**

当生存问题被解决，人类会伸手向更高层次：归属感、尊重、自我实现。他们想要体验，想要意义。然而，通往这些高层需求的传统路径：买房、职业晋升、财务安全，恰恰是被封死的。

### 推力 (The Push)

AI 正在席卷白领工作，这种焦虑不再是假设。ChatGPT、Midjourney、Cursor 和 Claude 正在取代初级岗位，这已成为普遍共识。白领阶层看着自己的职业生命线在萎缩。三年前，“AI 取代知识型工作者”还是个思想实验；现在，它是规划前提。

再加上**社交媒体**，它确保你永远不会对现状满意。算法经过优化，只为你展示“可能拥有”的下一层级。无论你在梯子的哪一级，总有人在你之上。

对于一个25岁、年入7万美元的人来说，参考群体不再是邻居，而是那些在巴厘岛“工作”四小时、年入 200 万美元的同龄人。**你永远追不上，这种差距被算法永远维系着。**

## 马斯洛陷阱 (The Maslow Trap)

当你能生存却无法更进一步时，有些东西会崩坏。原本用于生存的认知带宽转而变成了挫败感。职业晋升不只是收入，它是目的和身份；财务安全不只是金钱，它是自由。

当这些路径关闭，且达成时间线萎缩时，这些“囚徒”需要一条出路，而且他们**现在**就得出去。

## 赌场中的自主权 (Agency In The Casino)

同样是这群无法想象在一家公司熬日子的年轻人，却愿意熬上几个月学习加密货币交易或研究预测市场。

**为什么？**因为赌场是他们唯一感到有**自主权（Agency）**的地方。

- **传统路径**：你的经理升职是因为资历，且你的部门可能被自动化。
- **赌场（加密货币/博彩）**：你的研究和信念直接决定结果。即使是一个想象出来的优势，也是属于你自己的。

那些劝这些人“停止赌博”的人，未能理解囚徒的困境。对于许多人来说，赌博是他们的救赎，而你却在告诉他们接受永世不得翻身的生活。

## 数据表现 (What Do The Numbers Look Like?)

- **预测市场**：Polymarket 和 Kalshi 在2025年11月的交易额超过 100 亿美元。
- **体育博彩**：收入从2017年的2.48亿美元飙升至2024年的137亿美元，其中 76% 的活动来自 Z 世代和千禧一代。

这些博彩者被定义为“投机者”：年轻人被挡在传统财富建设门外，在唯一能提供不对称回报的市场中寻求突破。

## 经济理论支持 (Economic Theory Supports This)

经济学家称之为**“亏损状态下的凸性效用”（convex utility in losses）**：当你已经在输时，你宁愿要一个小概率回本的机会，也不愿接受一个确定的中度损失。

这一代人不是为了生存而赌，是为了**真正拥有生活**而赌。如果你的基线是“永远在原地踏步”，那么感知中5%的逃离机会在数学上比100%困在原地的机会更具吸引力。

## 做多“堕落” (Long Degeneracy)

如果你认同这个诊断，那么你就应该**做多任何满足这种需求的东西**。平台无论用户输赢都是赢家。

- **创业工业复合体**：卖教程、卖课程的教父们。
- **预测市场**：如 Polymarket 等平台。
- **加密基础设施**：Coinbase、交易所等。
- **体育博彩运营商**：DraftKings、FanDuel。
- **社交交易社区**：卖 Alpha 信息的 Discord 和 Substack。

这个赌注是押在“现象持续”上。西西弗斯正在填他的第401张彩票，而由于AI加速和住房成本，这种情况短期内不会改变。

## 道德维度与结论 (The Moral Dimension & Conclusion)

这个论点是描述性的。看着一代人通过彩票寻求救赎并不值得庆祝，它说明有些东西崩坏了。

你可以对此进行道德谴责，或者你可以**做多这些平台**。这冷酷地成为了你确实可以脱身的路径之一。如果你选择当赌徒，你最好非常优秀。

**结语**：我认识一个聪明人，上个月花了10万美元在永续DEX协议里刷分。他说：“不然我还能干嘛？存20年钱，等我55岁时买套公寓？”

**做多堕落主义。**
